# Event Management API

This is a Python application that allows the registration and management of events and their participants. The API was built with Flask and uses SQLAlchemy for data manipulation in the database. The application follows good REST API development practices, using the repository, interface, and controller design pattern. Additionally, it includes data validation with Cerberus and automated tests with Pytest.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Flask**: Framework for creating the REST API
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database manipulation
- **Cerberus**: Library for data validation
- **Pytest**: Framework for automated tests
- **Postman**: Tool for testing and validating API routes
